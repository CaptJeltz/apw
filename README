Awesome Pulseaudio Widget
=========================

Awesome Pulseaudio Widget (APW) is a little widget for
[Awesome WM](http://awesome.naquadah.org/), using the awful progressbar widget,
to display default's sink volume and control Pulseaudio.

It's compatible to Awesome 3.5.

First time I'm using Lua. So it might be a little bit quirky.

Usage
-----

Just put these line to the appropriate places.

```lua
-- Load the widget.
local APW = require("apw/widget")

-- Example: Add to wibox. Here to the right. Do it the way you like it.
right_layout:add(APW)

-- Configure the hotkeys.
awful.key({ }, "XF86AudioRaiseVolume",  function () pulseWidget.Up() end),
awful.key({ }, "XF86AudioLowerVolume",  function () pulseWidget.Down() end),
awful.key({ }, "XF86AudioMute",         function () pulseWidge.ToggleMute() end),

```

You could update the widget periodically, if you'd like, in case, the volume is
changed from somewhere else.

```lua
APWTimer = timer({ timeout = 0.5 }) -- set update interval in s
APWTimer:connect_signal("timeout", function() AWP.Update() end)
APWTimer:start()
```
